# KIBANA

Kibana is an open source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of 
logs in the form of line graph, bar graph, pie charts , heat maps, region maps, coordinate maps,
gauge, goals, timelion etc. The visualization makes it easy to predict or to see the changes in 
trends of errors or other significant events of the input source. Kibana works in sync with 
Elasticsearch and Logstash which together forms the so called ELK stack.

## What is Kibana used for?
Kibana's tight integration with Elasticsearch and the larger Elastic Stack make it ideal for 
supporting the following:
- Searching, viewing, and visualizing data indexed in Elasticsearch and analyzing the data 
  through the creation of bar charts, pie charts, tables, histograms, and maps. A dashboard 
  view combines these visual elements to then be shared via browser to provide real-time 
  analytical views into large data volumes in support of use cases such as:
  - Logging and log analytics
  - Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
  - Application performance monitoring (APM)
  - Geospatial data analysis and visualization
  - Security analytics
  - Business analytics
- Monitoring, managing, and securing an Elastic Stack instance via web interface.
- Centralizing access for built-in solutions developed on the Elastic Stack for observability, 
  security, and enterprise search applications.

## Features of Kibana
Kibana offers its users the following features −
### Visualization
Kibana has a lot of ways to visualize data in an easy way. Some of the ones which are commonly 
used are vertical bar chart, horizontal bar chart, pie chart, line graph, heat map etc.

### Dashboard
When we have the visualizations ready, all of them can be placed on one board – the Dashboard. 
Observing different sections together gives you a clear overall idea about what exactly is happening.

### Dev Tools
You can work with your indexes using dev tools. Beginners can add dummy indexes from dev tools and 
also add, update, delete the data and use the indexes to create visualization.

### Reports
All the data in the form of visualization and dashboard can be converted to reports (CSV format), 
embedded in the code or in the form of URLs to be shared with others.

### Filters and Search query
You can make use of filters and search queries to get the required details for a particular input 
from a dashboard or visualization tool.

### Plugins
You can add third party plugins to add some new visualization or also other UI addition in Kibana.

### Coordinate and Region Maps
A coordinate and region map in Kibana helps to show the visualization on the geographical map 
giving a realistic view of the data.

### Timelion
Timelion, also called as timeline is yet another visualization tool which is mainly used for time 
based data analysis. To work with timeline, we need to use simple expression language which helps 
us connect to the index and also perform calculations on the data to obtain the results we need. 
It helps more in comparison of data to the previous cycle in terms of week , month etc.

### Canvas
Canvas is yet another powerful feature in Kibana. Using canvas visualization, you can represent 
your data in different colour combinations, shapes, texts, multiple pages basically called as workpad.

## Advantages of Kibana
Kibana offers the following advantages to its users −
- Contains open source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of 
  logs in the form of line graph, bar graph, pie charts, heat maps etc.
- Simple and easy for beginners to understand.
- Ease of conversion of visualization and dashboard into reports.
- Canvas visualization help to analyse complex data in an easy way.
- Timelion visualization in Kibana helps to compare data backwards to understand the performance 
  better.

## Disadvantages of Kibana
- Adding of plugins to Kibana can be very tedious if there is version mismatch.
- You tend to face issues when you want to upgrade from older version to a new one.
