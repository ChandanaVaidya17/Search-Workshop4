# KIBANA DASHBOARDS

The best way to understand your data is to visualize it. With dashboards, you can turn your data 
from one or more data views into a collection of panels that bring clarity to your data, tell a 
story about your data, and allow you to focus on only the data thatâ€™s important to you.
### Index pattern
In a Kibana dashboard, an index pattern is used to define which Elasticsearch indices to search 
and visualize data from. When you create a dashboard, you start by specifying an index pattern, 
which can be a single index or a combination of multiple indices. Once you have defined the index 
pattern, you can use it to search for specific fields in your data and create visualizations 
based on that data.
### Panels
Panels display your data in charts, tables, maps, and more, which allow you to compare your data 
side-by-side to identify patterns and connections. Dashboards support several types of panels to 
display your data, and several options to create panels.
